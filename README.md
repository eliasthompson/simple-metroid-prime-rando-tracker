Disclaimer

I'm no artist, so many of these SVGs were hastily put together after referencing the in-game models. If anyone has or would like to make better icons for the tracker, get in touch. This tracker was also put together from scratch from another tracker, so apologizes for any extraneous code leftover that I didn't catch.
